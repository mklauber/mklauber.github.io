Welcome, I am Matthew Lauber, a software developer who enjoys playing with new programming patterns.  I'm starting this blog as a means for noting and describing programming patterns that I discover or use in my projects.  I'm hoping to use this as a resource to start identifying new patterns, and describing the best patterns for common use cases.

This blog is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  The source repo for it is [here](https://github.com/mklauber/mklauber.github.io).
