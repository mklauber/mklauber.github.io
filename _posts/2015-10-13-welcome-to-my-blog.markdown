This is my latest attempt at a reasonable blog.  I'm currently working on creating a turn based strategy game using [pyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/).  As I develop this game, it's my hope to produce blog posts describing many of my design choices, particularly with reference to [GameProgrammingPatterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).  This book is available online at [http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html).
